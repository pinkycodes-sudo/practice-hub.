\# 🧠 C++ Functions Practice



This folder contains beginner to intermediate level C++ exercises focused on \*\*non-recursive functions\*\*.



The goal of this section is to build a solid understanding of:

\- Creating and using functions

\- Working with different return types (`void`, `int`, `bool`, etc.)

\- Passing parameters

\- Separating logic from output

\- Solving real-world problems using function-based solutions



\## 📁 Folder Structure



Each problem is placed in its own subfolder with:

\- A short description in `README.md`

\- One or more `.cpp` solution files

\- Solutions using different function types when applicable





\## ✅ Topics Covered

\- Void functions

\- Value-retaining functions (`bool`, `int`, etc.)

\- Conditional logic inside functions

\- Basic math operations and decision-making

\- Input/output separation



\## 🏗️ In Progress

This is a growing practice space. More function-based problems and solutions will be added as I continue learning and improving.
