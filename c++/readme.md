\# C++ Practice



This folder contains all my practice problems and mini projects written in C++.



The problems are grouped into categories such as:

\- Loops

\- Functions

\- Arrays

\- Recursion

\- File handling

\- Other topics I cover as I learn



Each problem has:

\- A \*\*README.md\*\* with a short description

\- A \*\*.cpp\*\* file with the solution



This is part of my long-term learning journey and coding discipline routine.
