\# 🔁 C++ Recursion Practice



This folder contains beginner-friendly C++ exercises focused on \*\*recursive functions\*\*.



\## 🧠 Goal



To understand how recursion works in C++ by solving simple problems like factorial, Fibonacci, and more.



---



\## ✅ Topics Covered



\- Recursive function structure

\- Base cases and recursive cases

\- Call stack behavior

\- How recursion solves problems step-by-step



---



\## 📁 Folder Structure



Each problem includes:



\- A `main.cpp` file with the solution

\- A `README.md` that explains how the recursive logic works
