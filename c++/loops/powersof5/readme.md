\# Powers of 5 using For Loop



This C++ program demonstrates how to use a `for` loop to print the \*\*positive powers of 5\*\*, starting from 5 and continuing until the result is less than 500,000.

\## 🧠 Problem Description



The goal is to generate and print a sequence of numbers that are successive powers of 5 (e.g., 5, 25, 125, ...), using a `for` loop.

\## 💡 Code Logic



\- The loop initializes the variable `i` to 5.

\- The condition `i < 500000` ensures that the loop continues only while the value is less than 500,000.

\- The update expression `i = 5 \* i` multiplies `i` by 5 on every iteration.

\- Each value of `i` is printed on the same line with a space in between.

\- After the loop finishes, a newline is printed.
