\# Print Numbers using For Loop



This program demonstrates a basic \*\*for loop\*\* in C++.



\## Problem Description



The goal is to print the first 10 non-negative integers starting from 0.  

The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i < 10` and prints each number followed by a space.



\## Code Explanation



\- The loop initializes `i` to 0.

\- The condition `i < 10` keeps the loop running until `i` reaches 9.

\- After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 (`i++`).

\- Each value of `i` is printed on the same line, separated by spaces.

\- After the loop completes, a newline character is printed.



\## Sample Output



0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
