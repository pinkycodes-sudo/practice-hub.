\# Count Down using For Loop



This program demonstrates how to use a `for` loop to count backwards in C++.



\## Problem Description



The goal is to print numbers in \*\*reverse order\*\* from 10 down to 0 using a `for` loop.



\## Code Explanation



\- The loop initializes `i` to 10.

\- The condition `i >= 0` ensures the loop continues as long as `i` is 0 or greater.

\- After each iteration, `i` is decremented by 1 (`i--`).

\- Each value of `i` is printed on the same line, separated by spaces.

\- After the loop completes, a newline is printed.



\## Sample Output

10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
