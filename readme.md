\# Practice Repository



Welcome to my Practice Repository!



This is where I will be practicing mini projects, coding exercises, and learning different programming concepts.



The practice work will be organized by programming language and by topic to keep everything neat and easy to find.



\## What you'll find here:

\- C++ practice: loops, functions, recursion, and more

\- Java practice: object-oriented programming and basics

\- Other languages and topics as I learn them



This repository will be regularly updated as I improve and add new projects.



Feel free to explore and track my coding journey! ðŸš€
