\# Java Practice ☕️



This folder contains all my practice problems and mini projects written in Java.



The problems are grouped into categories such as:



\- Basics (printing, variables, data types)

\- Loops

\- Methods

\- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

\- File handling

\- Other topics I cover as I learn



Each problem has:



\- A \*\*README.md\*\* with a short description

\- A \*\*.java\*\* file with the solution



This is part of my long-term learning journey and coding discipline routine.
