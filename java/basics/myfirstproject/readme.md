\## 🍕 My First Project

This is one of my first Java programs. It prints a few lines about pizza using both print and println statements to practice basic output formatting.

\### 👩‍💻 Concepts Practiced

\- `System.out.print()` and `System.out.println()`  

\- Escape characters (`\\n`)  

\- Java program structure with the `main` method

\### 📌 Output





I love pizza!

It's so good.

I could eat it everyday.

Even when coding.
