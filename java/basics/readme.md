\# ☕ Java Basics Practice



This folder contains beginner-level Java exercises focused strictly on the \*\*absolute basics\*\* of Java.



The goal of this section is to build a solid foundation in:



\- Writing and running simple Java programs  

\- Using variables and data types (like `int`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`, etc.)  

\- Performing basic math and string operations  

\- Practicing simple console input and output  



> 🛑 \*\*Note:\*\* This folder does \*\*not\*\* include conditionals (`if`, `else`), loops, or methods. Those topics will each have their own dedicated folders as I progress.

\## 📁 Folder Structure



Each program is placed in its own subfolder or file with:



\- A brief description in `README.md` (if needed)  

\- One or more `.java` files containing the source code

\## 🏗️ In Progress



This is a growing practice space. More Java basics programs and projects will be added as I continue learning and building my skills.
